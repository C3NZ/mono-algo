# mono-algo

## Description
This is a collection of all of my algorithms and data structures 
in any language. All of the solutions are to be built with bazel.

## How to run/setup
In the root directory...
```bash
pushd src/cpp/hackerrank
bazel run -c opt :hello_world
```
This will run my dummy hello world example I did for hackerrank in c++. Any
folder that has build files can build and run programs in their respective 
languages.
